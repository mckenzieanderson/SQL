-- In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(acctnum), avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Customers
ON FebSales.orderID = Customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
